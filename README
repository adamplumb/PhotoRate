PhotoRate is a nautilus file manager extension (for GNOME) that allows you to rate an image from 1 to 5 from the context menu, where rating the imagge modifies its metadata (using the pyexiv2 library).  There are two mechanisms to display the current rating to the user.  One is a column that you can add by going to Edit -> Preferences -> List Columns, and then check the "Rating" column.  The other mechanism is, if you've installed the emblems, each photo will show an emblem next to it corresponding to its rating.
